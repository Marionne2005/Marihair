      <p>
       It all started in Cotonou, Benin, under the warm hands and kind heart of <strong>Maman Iman</strong>.
       She wasn't just a hairstylist she was an artist. Watching her braid with such care, love, and precision sparked something in me.
       Day after day, I stood beside her, learning, observing, and slowly falling in love with the magic of hair braiding.
     </p>
     <p>
       Soon, I began practicing on my own. My friends became my canvas.
       I braided their hair for free not for money, but for the joy of learning and growing.
       I asked questions, sought feedback, and welcomed every piece of advice from experienced hairstylists around me.
     </p>
     <p>
      Through the ups and downs, my family was always there.
      They carried me with their encouragement, showed up for every small milestone, and reminded me that my passion had a purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
       And so, <strong>Marihair</strong> was born not just a brand, but a dream woven from patience, practice, community, and love.
       Every braid tells a story, and mine began with gratitude and a deep passion for making people feel confident and seen.</p>
